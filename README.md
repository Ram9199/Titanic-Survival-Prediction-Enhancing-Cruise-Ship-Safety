    "# Titanic Survival Prediction: Enhancing Cruise Ship Safety\n",
    "\n",
    "## Industry: Tourism & Hospitality\n",
    "## Domain: Maritime Safety & Risk Management\n",
    "\n",
    "### üö¢ Use Case Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze historical Titanic passenger data, we aim to develop predictive models that can enhance modern cruise ship safety protocols. Our AI-powered \"Safety Companion\" system can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify high-risk passengers\n",
    "2. Optimize evacuation procedures\n",
    "3. Personalize safety briefings\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Develop and compare machine learning models to predict passenger survival probability, forming the foundation of the \"Safety Companion\" system for cruise ships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Models\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Logistic Regression: For interpretability and baseline performance\n",
    "   - Achieved 79.80% accuracy on training data\n",
    "   - Implemented with feature normalization\n",
    "2. Deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN): For capturing complex patterns and higher accuracy\n",
    "   - Achieved 82.49% accuracy on training data\n",
    "   - Architecture: Input layer, hidden layers [128, 64, 32], output layer\n",
    "   - Used 'sriram' activation function for improved performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìä Key Features (by importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Passenger Class (Pclass)\n",
    "2. Sex\n",
    "3. Age\n",
    "4. Family Size\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing & EDA\n",
    "   - Normalized all features using Z-score normalization\n",
    "   - Focused on key features: Sex, Age, FamilySize, and Passenger Class\n",
    "2. Model Development (Logistic Regression & Deep ANN)\n",
    "3. Performance Comparison\n",
    "4. Feature Importance Analysis\n",
    "5. Training Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåü Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Performance:\n",
    "   - Deep ANN outperformed Logistic Regression by 2.69 percentage points\n",
    "   - Suggests presence of non-linear relationships in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Importance:\n",
    "   - Passenger Class (especially 3rd class) is the strongest predictor of survival\n",
    "   - Sex is almost equally important, confirming \"women and children first\" policy\n",
    "   - Age has moderate importance\n",
    "   - Family Size contributes least but still relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Survival Factors:\n",
    "   - Lower class passengers were at higher risk\n",
    "   - Gender played a significant role in survival chances\n",
    "   - Age was a factor, but less impactful than class and gender\n",
    "   - Family size had some influence on survival predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Non-linear Relationships:\n",
    "   - Deep ANN's superior performance indicates complex interactions between features\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîú Implications and Future Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prioritize risk assessment based on multiple factors, not single attributes\n",
    "2. Pay special attention to passengers in lower classes during emergencies\n",
    "3. Balance gender and age considerations in evacuation protocols with ethical concerns\n",
    "4. Utilize the Deep ANN model for more accurate risk assessments\n",
    "5. Future steps:\n",
    "   - Gather more detailed data on cabin locations and lifeboat proximity\n",
    "   - Incorporate real-time factors like passenger location on the ship\n",
    "   - Develop a user-friendly interface for crew members\n",
    "   - Conduct simulations to test and refine the system\n",
    "   - Address ethical implications and potential biases in the model's recommendations"
